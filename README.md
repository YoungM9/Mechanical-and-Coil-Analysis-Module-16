# Mechanical-and-Coil-Analysis-Module-16


A metric to be tested is mentioned (5 pt)
I would venture to gather data on the car model or how old the suspension col is and then running tests on strength 

A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described 
null is that the age or car model has no affect on the effectiveness on a suspension coil and the alternative is that it does

A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis 

I would use a linear regression/multi linear regression model
